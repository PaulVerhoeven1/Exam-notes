### ARM templates
Azure Resource Manager templates, a.k.a. terraform for Azure


Scale Set: Autoscaling for VM's in Azure

App services: FaaS service of azure

Vnet Peering: Peering 2 subnet

Network security groups (NSG): firewall, defines inbound and outbound ports
Service Endpoints: privately connect VNet subnet to Azure PaaS services
Private Endpoints: connection to a specific instance of a service, it is a networkcard inside the the network
### **Azure Functions**

Only pay when the function is running
Built-in monitoring with Azure Monitor
#### Structure
**Input bindings:** is a way of declaratively connecting another resource to the function
**Trigger**: cause a function to run. A trigger defines how a function is invoked and a function must have exactly one trigger
**Function App:** the app itself (code with application runtime config)
**Output bindings:** is a way of declaratively connecting another resource to the function

Authorization levels (who can access the function):
- Anonymous (everybody has access)
- Function (api key required, the default)
- Admin

Log streaming and metric streaming: streaming the logs and metrics to see the output

Can be running on K8S with KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven autoscaling)
## Storage

Storage Account: Globally unique, files in it are accessable

Blob storage is like s3
Azure stores always at minimum 3 copies

### Copy files
AzCopy: Cli tool to copy to blobs or Azure files
Storage Explorer: GUI interface to explorer the storage (drag and drop)
Azure File Sync: synchs azure files from on-prem to the cloud (like NFS)

Azure Data Box: migrate a lot of data (pb's) to the cloud like AWS Snowball



## Authentication and Authorization

Azure AD: AD from azure in the cloud, new name is Entra ID
Tenant: is a organization inside AAD

Conditional access policies: if user meets certain conditions it can do more

Azure Sentinal: SIEM tool, analyzes threads (behaviour analyses)


## Monitoring in Azure

Azure Monitor: Monitor the health
Azure service health: Dashboard with an overview of the health of your services
Azure compliance manager: to see if you are compliant with like GDPR, ISO etc. 

Azure ARC: connecting on-prem servers so azure to manage them in one interface. It does this by installing an agent.
