- Anonymous (everybody has access)
- Function (api key required, the default)
- Admin

Log streaming and metric streaming: streaming the logs and metrics to see the output

Can be running on K8S with KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven autoscaling)

Azure ARC: connecting on-premise servers so azure to manage them in one interface. It does this by installing an agent.

## IoT in Azure
**IoT Hub:** central place to get IoT messages, PaaS service
**IoT Central:** Dashboards and components to set up IoT devices
**Azure Sphere:** All-in-one solution for IoT devies on azure, you need to have specific hardware and specific software on the devices make it work with azure.


## Big Data  in Azure
**Data Lake Analytics:** Parallel processing of big data
**HDInsight:** Using open source frameworks (Kafka, Hadoop, Spark etc)
**Azure Databricks:** Uses generative AI with the data lake house to understand the semantics of the data. It is using Apache Spark
**Azure Synapse Analytics**: Azure\s data warehouse offering


## Databases in Azure
**Cosmos DB:**
- Managed NoSQL database
- Globally Available
- Supports different kinds of databases:
	- MongoDB Api: MongoDB database
	- Core SQL: Document datastore
	- Azure Table: key/value store
